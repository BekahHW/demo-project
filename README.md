## 🧠 Tips

- Keep the repo as-is. Let the workflow do the work.
- Check the PR tab after running a workflow.
- Try combining prompts: e.g., “Fix the bug and add a unit test.”

---

## 🏆 Bonus Challenge (Optional)

After you’ve tested the basics:
- Add a new file with a small bug.
- Write your own custom rule in Continue Hub.
- Automate fixing it with your own workflow.
